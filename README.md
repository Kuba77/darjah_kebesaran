# Malaysian Honorific Title

## Dataset

An interesting [data source](https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/4ovwdt/if_you_need_to_check_if_someone_is_a_datuk_or_not/) was pointed out by Reddit user. The site has a complete list of names of people who are awarded with honorific titles in Malaysia from the year 1958 to 2015.

Utilizing a simple Python script, the complete name list is extracted into a CSV file. The columns of the CSV file includes "Anugerah" (name of the title), "Bil" (identification number), "Nama" (recipient of award), "Singkatan" (acronym) and "Tahun Kurniaan" (year of award).
